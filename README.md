# CarDataRecorder

Within this project a small data recording app is introduced. This app is meant to run on Android smartphones. Following inputs can be measured: 
* video data taken from mobile phone with selectable resolution (access to phone's camera and audio recording necessary)
* phone sensor data (like accelerometer, light-sensor, GPS-position)
* OBD2 device via Bluetooth (like ELM327)
